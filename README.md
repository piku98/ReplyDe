# A chat application which doesn't store any of your user information or the chat history. 
User info and chats are not stored, no database at all. The server just passes the messages to clients and as the clients leave the chat the user info (userid and name) is also deleted.
Steps to use:
1. Once you open the page you will be asked for a username and will be assigned a temporary id (active till the tab is open).
2. You create a chat room.
3. Share chat room id with others.
4. People join the chat room.
5. Chat.
6. Once everyone leaves the chat room it is deleted.
